# MyFirstapp
This is my first ever desktop app that I've created.  

App is a scoreboard for ice hockey, football and floorball. 
Fucntionality:
1. You can save teams in the system. 
2. You can start a game between two teams.
3. During the game you can add goals for each team. You can also add points for players.
4. After the game, score and points will be saved.
5. You can check player's points and scoreboard of different sports. 

For saving I used XML file format.
